<img src="../recipes/bolognese.jpg" alt="Bolognese Pasta">

<p>This fettuccine carbonara is a delectable, mouth-watering pile of yummy goodness! I recommend a nice salad with it â€” that's all you will need for a complete meal.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Carrot</li>
    <li>Rib</li>
    <li>Pancetta</li>
    <li>Pasta</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan until shimmering. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture into a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the saucepan and heat until just shimmering. Add the beef, veal, and pork and cook over moderately high heat until just barely pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Return the vegetable mixture to the saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
